# PyPong
Pong Game developed with python PyGame library. A project for my portfolio? Maybe.  

Just a bored Computer Science student here, his flatmate did a snake game in a couple lines of code and I decided to make my own too.  

You can go check his programming channel, after all, this would not be possible without him.
